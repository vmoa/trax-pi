# Park Detector KiCad files

This is a static copy of the [TRax-Schematic](../TRax-Schematic) project at v1.7 with everythig stripped
out except for the park detector.  Reason being that KiCad doesn't appear to have a way to lay out a board
based on only part of a schematic.

**Caveat Emptor**: Changes made to the main schematic will have to be replicated here.  (Boo...)
