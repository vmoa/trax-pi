# KiCad Files

[KiCad](https://kicad.org/) (pronounced KEY-cad) is a Cross Platform and Open Source Electronics Design Automation Suite.

This directory contains the design files for the TRax hardware. Source is KiCad but I have exported as PDF/JPG.

* **TRax-BlockDiagram** Work in progress to document the overall system
* **TRax-Controller** Schematic and PCB layout of the controller board
* **TRax-Relays** TRax relays and connector woring
